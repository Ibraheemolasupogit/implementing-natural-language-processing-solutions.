**Tokenization · POS/NER · Text Classification · Semantics & Sentiment · Topic Modeling · Word Embeddings · Chatbots (DL)**

> Practical, production-minded Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementations in Python, from classic preprocessing to deep-learning chatbots, with clean patterns you can reuse anywhere.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository consolidates end-to-end NLP workflows: text ingestion and cleaning, linguistic annotation (POS/NER), classical ML pipelines for classification, semantics and sentiment analysis, topic modeling (LDA/NMF), word embeddings (train & pretrained), and deep-learning text generation/chatbots. (“NLP Ops”).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build **runnable NLP pipelines** with clear, minimal Python code.
* Compare **spaCy** and **NLTK** idioms for core tasks.
* Apply **scikit-learn** text features (Count, TF-IDF) in classification.
* Practice **semantics & sentiment** with word vectors and polarity.
* Explore **unsupervised topic modeling** (LDA, NMF) end-to-end.
* Understand and use **word embeddings** (train from scratch & use pretrained).
* Prototype **chatbots** and **text generation** with RNN/LSTM-based workflows.

## 🧩 What’s Inside (NLP-only)

### 📥 Text Basics & Preprocessing

* Loading **text/PDF** sources and normalizing raw text.
* **Regular expressions** for cleaning, patterning, and extraction.

### 🧱 NLP Python Basics (spaCy & NLTK)

* **Tokenization**: robust splitting strategies for downstream tasks.
* **Stemming & Lemmatization**: reducing words to roots/lemmas.
* **Stop-word handling**: removing frequent, low-signal tokens.
* **Vocabulary & Phrase Matching**: rule-based patterns for key phrases.

### 🧠 Linguistic Annotation & Visualization

* **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging**: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: people, orgs, places, etc.
* **Sentence Segmentation**: reliable sentence boundaries for pipelines.
* Visualizing **POS** and **NER** for QA and explainability.

### 📊 Text Classification (Classical ML)

* End-to-end **scikit-learn** workflow and ML hygiene.
* **Count Vectorization** and **TF-IDF** feature extraction.
* A complete **text classification project** (from features to evaluation).

### 🔎 Semantics & Sentiment

* **Word vectors / Word2Vec** concepts for semantic similarity.
* **Sentiment analysis**: positive/negative polarity at document or sentence level.

### 🧵 Topic Modeling (Unsupervised)

* **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**.
* A complete **topic modeling project** with LDA/NMF outputs and interpretation.

### 🧬 Word Embeddings

* **Introduction to embeddings** (what/why/how).
* **Train embeddings** from scratch (two passes: setup and refinement).
* **Use pretrained embeddings** for faster, stronger baselines.
* (Includes a short **self-check/quiz** on embeddings.)

### 🤖 Deep Learning for NLP (Chatbots & Generation)

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** intuition.
* **Text generation** patterns (prompting, temperature, sequence length).
* **Chatbot fundamentals**: intent handling, response generation loops.

## 🧪 Example Workflows (at a glance)

* **Regex + tokenization** → clean corpus ready for analysis.
* **POS/NER** → extract entities and grammatical roles for downstream use.
* **Count/TF-IDF + Linear models** → fast, strong baselines for classification.
* **Word2Vec** → compute similarities and simple semantic search.
* **LDA/NMF** → discover themes/topics in unlabeled text.
* **RNN/LSTM text gen** → prototype a simple conversational or generative loop.
